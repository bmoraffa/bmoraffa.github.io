<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Instructor: Dr <a href="https://bmoraffah.github.io" target="_blank">Bahman Moraffah</a><br />
Email: <a href="mailto:bahman.moraffah@asu.edu" target="_blank">bahman.moraffah@asu.edu</a><br />
Lecture: Online<br />
Laboratory: Online<br />
Office Hours: TBA <br />
Zoom Room Link: TBA</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>Analog, digital microelectronic circuits and systems. Gate sizing, timing analysis, sequential digital circuits, memory. Single-stage and differential amplifiers, frequency response.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites and Requirements</h2>
<p>Engineering BS/BSE students. Must have completed EEE 334 or equivalent with a grade of D or better.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Course</h2>
<p>This course is an area pathway course for the electronic and mixed signal circuit design emphasis in Electrical Engineering. It is a continuation of EEE 334, Circuits II. In EEE 334, students were introduced to the fundamentals of transistors and electronic circuits. This course will be the first real electronic circuit design course, focusing on constructing both digital and analog circuits. Actual designs will be realized in the companion laboratory, where students will be required to build and simulate specific circuits, from CMOS logic gates to differential amplifiers, using the CADENCE EDA tool. A crucial feature of this course is its treatment of the time and frequency domain responses of electronic circuits. Students are strongly encouraged to review not only what they learned in EEE 334 but also the network analysis principles covered in EEE 202, Circuits I.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p><em>Microelectronic Circuits, 8th Ed.</em> Oxford University Press, 2019, by Adel S. Sedra, Kenneth C. Smith, Tony C. Carusone, and Vincent Gaudet.</p>

<h2>Submitting Assignments</h2>
<p>All assignment submissions and deadlines will be handled through Canvas. Late submissions will not be accepted unless excused for valid reasons such as medical emergencies or other special circumstances with proper documentation.</p>

<h2>Late or Missed Assignments or Exams:</h2>
<p>If a medical emergency occurs that causes a late assignment or lab submission, or missing an exam, please contact Prof. Moraffah as soon as possible with appropriate documentation from a medical provider. For religious observances or university-sanctioned events, accommodations can be arranged if requested well in advance of the occurrence.</p>

<h2>Student Success:</h2>
<p>To be successful in EEE 335, please read all course material and complete all homework assignments and labs. Start labs early as they can be time-consuming. Ask questions during lectures, office hours, and on Ed Discussion. Actively participating in Ed Discussion can be particularly useful for clarifying homework questions since other students may have similar questions.</p>


<h2>Communicating With the Instructor</h2>
<p><strong>Ed Discussion:</strong> Ed Discussion will be the official platform used for communications in this course. Please use it actively to engage with the course content and your peers.</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> When emailing Prof. Moraffah related to this course, please include "EEE 335" in the subject line to ensure a prompt response.</p>

  <h2>Ed Discussion</h2>
<p>Search before you post.</p>
<p>Heart questions and answers you find useful.</p>
<p>Answer questions you feel confident answering.</p>
<p>Share interesting course-related content with staff and peers.</p>
<p>It is encouraged that all students participate in answering questions. Be confident in your answers, but don't hesitate to share your thoughts.</p>
<p>If a fellow student shares an answer, feel free to offer your own solution or provide corrections.</p>
<p>Helping your classmates before the instructor intervenes benefits both you and your peers.</p>
<p>Consistent participation and answering questions before the instructor will earn you extra credit, which will be applied directly to your final grade. Note that there is NO curve for this class but you are provided with opportunities to earn some extra credit.</p>
  
<h2>Additional Course Comments and Policies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Covid Mitigation Strategy: If you cannot physically be on campus due to personal health concerns, please contact Prof. Moraffah to discuss alternative arrangements.</li>
    <li>Technology Requirements: This course requires the following technologies: a reliable internet connection, a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), Adobe Acrobat Reader, a webcam, microphone, and Microsoft Office. These tools are essential for participating in online lectures, completing assignments, and communicating with the instructor.</li>
    <li>Academic Integrity: Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, and laboratory work. Any form of cheating or plagiarism will result in severe academic consequences, including a potential grade of E or XE for the course.</li>
