                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Knowledge distillation is a machine learning technique wherein a smaller, simpler model (the <span class="math">student</span> model) is trained to emulate the performance of a larger, more complex model (the <span class="math">teacher</span> model). This method aims to retain the teacher's performance while using fewer resources.</p>
            </section>
<section>
    <h2>Detailed Explanation of Knowledge Distillation</h2>
    <p>Knowledge distillation is a technique where a compact, less complex student model learns from both the categorical labels and the soft outputs (class probabilities) generated by a more robust teacher model. This approach enables the student model to mimic the sophisticated decision boundaries learned by the teacher, thus preserving performance with less computational overhead.</p>
    <subsection>
        <h3>Loss Function</h3>
        <p>The loss function in knowledge distillation combines cross-entropy loss and a distillation loss, facilitating learning from both categorical labels and soft targets:</p>
        <p class="equation">\[ L = (1 - \alpha) \cdot L_{CE}(\text{Softmax}(S), Y) + \alpha \cdot T^2 \cdot L_{KL}(\text{Softmax}(S/T), \text{Softmax}(T/T)) \]</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>\( \text{Softmax}(z_i) \)</strong>: Defined as \( \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}} \), where \( z \) are the logits from a model. When scaled by \( T \), the softmax becomes \( \text{Softmax}(z_i/T) = \frac{e^{z_i/T}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j/T}} \), which adjusts the "sharpness" of the probability distribution based on the value of \( T \).</li>
            <li><strong>\( L_{CE}(\text{Softmax}(S), Y) \)</strong>: The cross-entropy loss measures the discrepancy between the predicted probabilities \( \text{Softmax}(S) \) of the student and the true labels \( Y \). It is defined mathematically as \( -\sum_{i} Y_i \log(\text{Softmax}(S_i)) \), where \( Y_i \) are the indicator variables for class membership.</li>
            <li><strong>\( L_{KL} \)</strong>: The Kullback-Leibler divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. \( L_{KL}(\text{Softmax}(S/T), \text{Softmax}(T/T)) \) quantifies the divergence between the softened outputs of the student and the teacher, promoting similarity in their probabilistic outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Substituting these definitions into the loss function, we get:</p>
        <p class="equation">\[ L = (1 - \alpha) \cdot (-\sum_{i} Y_i \log(\text{Softmax}(S_i))) + \alpha \cdot T^2 \cdot \sum_i (\text{Softmax}(S_i/T) \log(\frac{\text{Softmax}(S_i/T)}{\text{Softmax}(T_i/T)})) \]</p>
    </subsection>
    <section>
        <h2>Training and Inference in Knowledge Distillation</h2>
        <p>The training of a distilled model involves adjusting the student to the teacher's outputs over several iterations. Initially, the student model learns directly from the hard targets (true labels) using cross-entropy. As training progresses, the focus shifts increasingly towards mimicking the softened outputs of the teacher, guided by the KL divergence. The balance between these objectives is controlled by the hyperparameter \( \alpha \), and the temperature \( T \) modulates the softening of probabilities.</p>
        <p>During inference, the student model operates independently, utilizing the compactness and efficiency gained through distillation. The student model can make predictions on new data with reduced computational demands compared to the original teacher model, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>

                <h2>Applications in Diffusion Generative Models</h2>
                <p>Knowledge distillation has been increasingly applied in the training of diffusion generative models. By distilling the knowledge from a high-fidelity generative model into a simpler one, it is possible to significantly reduce the computational complexity needed to generate new samples while maintaining high quality.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Knowledge distillation provides a powerful solution for deploying complex machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, thereby broadening the accessibility and application of advanced AI technologies.</p>
